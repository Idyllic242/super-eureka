      <h1 class="w3-center">Why is food wasted?</h1><br>
      <p class="w3-large">Food is lost or wasted throughout the supply chain.

        Food that gets spilled or spoilt before harvesting – or when being stored, packed or transported – is known as food loss. Food loss can be caused by weather or insects, or by high temperatures and poor storage.
        
        Food that is fit for human consumption, but isn't eaten, is called food waste . It's been left to go off or is thrown away. One cause of food waste is when shops suddenly stop ordering unpopular food products – or change supplier – leaving stocks to go bad.
        
        It also happens in shops and homes when we buy more food than can be sold or eaten.
        
        Our food system plays a big part in climate change – so it makes sense to reduce the amount of food we waste.</p>

      <p class="w3-large">Did you know that up to 40% of all food produced is wasted?
         That's a lot of wasted money and resources.
          Our food waste management services can help you save money and reduce your environmental impact.<br>

          
          
           Wasted food has far-reaching effects, both nationally and globally. In the India, up to 40% of all food produced goes uneaten ,
            and about 95% of discarded food ends up in landfills . It is the largest component of municipal solid waste at 21%. 
             In 2014, more than 38 million tons of food waste was generated, with only 5% diverted from landfills and incinerators for composting.
              Decomposing food waste produces methane, a strong greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.
               Worldwide, one-third of food produced is thrown away uneaten,
            causing an increased burden on the environment.

      <h1 class="w3-center">Can I cut food packaging waste too?</h1><br>
      <p class="w3-large">You can reduce black bin waste by buying products packaged in recyclable and biodegradable materials.

        Feeling more radical? Search for shops – like Bulk Market  in London – 
        that allow you to refill your oils, washing liquids and a whole host of other things.
        
        Manufacturers and supermarkets need to do much more to cut down on unneeded packaging. We want to see 100% reusable or recyclable materials. That's why we're asking coffee shops to develop reusable and recyclable alternatives to their one-use cups.</p>

        <p class="w3-large">The government could halve food waste by 2030 by:<br>

          Getting every point of the supply chain to report on – and reduce – food waste.<br>
          Requiring all edible food surplus to be offered to hungry people, and then to animals as feed.<br>
          Requiring all inedible food waste to be composted or used to generate energy, not sent to landfill.<br>
          And in the meantime, businesses could:<br>
          
          Stop demanding perfectly-shaped grub so that no edible food is wasted in the field.<br>
          Educate customers about food waste and how to avoid it.<br>
          Support measures to treat farmers well – avoiding unfair deals that lead to food waste.<br>
          Work with food redistribution charities to get all surplus food to people who really need it.<br>
